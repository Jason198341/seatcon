# Conference Chat Application Project Plan

## Overview
This project implements a real-time multilingual chat application for conferences, allowing participants and presenters to communicate in their preferred languages with automatic translation. The application will be used during a conference featuring various exhibits and presentations as detailed in the provided documentation.

## Key Features
